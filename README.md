# Mapty

Mapty is a Project I follow along in my Javascript course. It gave me a solid understanding of many concepts for building Web Projects, working with object and classes and using open-source libraries. I spent a enormous amount of time analyzing logic and the way teacher simplifying and solving problems

Right after I finished this project with instructor, I implemented a piece of functionality to settle down knowledge. I will revise Mapty again, when I will learn asynchronous JS section.
